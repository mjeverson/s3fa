    Site 3 Fire Arts is a community group made up of volunteers from a variety
    of different backgrounds. Based out of Site 3 coLaboratory, a makerspace
    in downtown Toronto, we create interactive fire projects that bring
    together art, engineering, software programming, stagecraft and game
    design. Our goal? Encourage friendly competition and the ridiculous
    smack talking that goes along with it by creating new ways for
    participants to control fire beyond just pushing buttons.

<div><h2>The Project (2012 Burning Man Honourarium)</h2>
    <p>Super
        Street Fire is a live-action adaptation of Street Fighter 2 only with
        the fire of a thousands suns. Set on a real-life version of Ryu&#8217;s
        classic stage, Super Street Fire sees two brave fighters duke it out
        while wearing motion-sensing gloves that capture every throw from
        perfectly timed blocks to deadly hadoukens. With each attack, fire
        hurtles towards the opponent as they scramble to retaliate or succumb to
        fiery damage. Still remember combos? Good. The stronger the attack, the
        greater the spectacle. As the countdown clock winds down, punches are
        thrown, life is lost, and a victor is named.

<div><h2>The Nerd Porn: Wearables</h2>
    <p>Similar
        to a Nintendo Wii-mote, the custom designed motion-sensing gloves
        contain intertial measurement units that capture a player&#8217;s
        actions. It then wirelessly sends this data to a game server that
        detects if those actions match one of the pre-trained game gestures. If
        the gesture is recognized, the game system gives feedback to the player
        by activating the flame effects.
    </p>

<div><h2>The Nerd Porn: Flame Effects</h2>
    <p>The
        32 flame effect heads are propane-fed devices that emit a column of
        fire high into the air. Flame effects are expressed as two rails of
        eight computer controlled flame effect heads, one rail for the right
        hand gestures and one for the left, as well as an outer ring of sixteen
        flame effects triggered by special combos or controlled by the Master of
        Games for crowd engagement. The game system is computer hardware and
        software with an Arduino microcontroller that interfaces with the flame
        effect head solenois to regulate both the intensity and duration of the
        flame.

    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>What
        could possibly be better than Skee Ball? How about fire-erupting Skee
        Ball? Lovingly dubbed Riskee Ball, this reimagined arcade staple will
        blast fire from the central row of target holes and straight out the top
        when some serious celebrating is in order. Topped with rotating warning
        lights and air horns to signal special game modes, like sudden death
        eruption mode where points scored on one machine triggers flames on them
        all, this bank of ten modular machines are the perfect addition to any
        pyromaniac&#8217;s arcade. Play it at the Charcade, a 2013 Burning Man Honourarium project.

    <h2>The Nerd Porn: Flame Effects</h2>
    <p>The
        flame effect control system is custom designed hardware that will
        activate the five flame effects on each machine. One large effect head
        will connect to two outlets on the top, and four flame effects will fire
        through the target holes. Feeding of the machine&#8217;s
        primary fuel line, a low pressure pilot system made of perforated
        copper pipe will circle each of the four central holes, so they glow
        with a constant ring of flame. The machines themselves will be
        constructed using formed aluminum, and the ramps will be made of
        aluminum sheet that can be rolled for easy transportation to our
        favourite dust city.

    <h2>Special Thanks to Our Fire-Loving Volunteers</h2>
    <p>Sometimes
        it was freezing cold. Sometimes it rained all over our precious circuit

        awesome volunteers for saying, “fuck it” and showing up anyway. You know
        who you are.</p>
